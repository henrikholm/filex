### Project Filex ###


-- Previous project / Inspiration --
This project is based on the code from Bones7456 (https://code.google.com/p/bones7456/) "SimpleHttpServer with Upload". 
I've tried to get in contact with him/her, to send over my modifications, but with no luck.


-- Features --
1. Upload of files to working directory
2. Download of files from working directory
3. Username / Password protection (standard http)
4. External IP-address lookup
5. Auto-shutdown after max 72 hours, default 1 hour


-- Invocation --
Simply run "python filex.py" in a terminal
